FINAL CONFESS WEBSITE - Offline-ready instructions

Included files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- assets/README_add_files.txt

To enable offline background & music:
1) Save your chosen background image as 'background.jpg' and put it in the 'assets' folder.
2) Save your mp3 (the track you want) as 'bgm.mp3' and put it in the 'assets' folder.
3) Open index.html in a browser and press 'Lanjut' to start music + text.

Notes:
- Mobile browsers require a user interaction to play audio. The 'Lanjut' button triggers the audio play.
- If audio still doesn't play, try tapping the page once then press 'Lanjut' again.
- For better quality, choose an MP3 ~128-320 kbps and rename it 'bgm.mp3'.
